Release Instructions

How to build a new release of Impro-Visor

1. In src/imp/gui/AboutDialog.java, change the version number in two places.

2. In src/imp/Improvisor.java, change the version number.

3. In build.xml change the version numbers. For example, version 5.01 is 501
   and version 10.1 is 1010.

4. In README.txt change the version number 
   and add release notes for the new version.

5. From the command line, run
       ant dist
   to build the distribution. The result will be in improvisorXXXX where XXXX
   is the version number as above.

6. Also run
       ant zip      for the generic archive
       ant zipSrc   to zip the sources

7. Run install4j. You will have to change a bunch of version numbers, 
   directories, etc. You will need to navigate to the dist directory, 
   improvisorXXXX, which will be added to the distribution tree. You will
   need to change the version number for MacOSx, Windows, etc. separately.

   Don't skip any steps. Use the arrow at the upper right.

8. Save configuration.install4j with the source tree. Do not regenerate the
   application id.

9. Start the build in install4j (Build All).

10. Test the installation, then fix problems or upload to distribution site.
