FirstTimeDialog.aboutText.text=\ \ Welcome to Improvisation Advisor version 10.\n\n  Tutorials: http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/jazz/improvisor/tutorials.html\n\n  This message will appear only the first time you launch a new version.\n  It can be revisited from the Help menu.\n\n  On first launch, Impro-Visor will copy various files from the\n  installation directory to your home directory, in folder:\n\n       impro-visor-version-10-files\n\n  These include leadsheets, styles, and vocabulary. If you want to preserve \n  files from previous versions, you will need to move or copy them manually. \n  This is so Impro-Visor does not overwrite files that you might have\n  modified. When that directory is present, it tells Impro-Visor not to copy\n  the files on next launch and not to show this message again.\n  \n  To get sound, you may need to set the MIDI Output Preference.\n  (You can use the button below.) It should be set to one of:\n\n        Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth  \n        Microsoft MIDI Mapper\n        Gervill\n \n  or some other device or program that supports MIDI input. The latter needs\n  to be running at the time the Impro-Visor is launched, but can be left on.\n\n  Other information can be found in the release notes, in README.txt, and \n  also on the web at https://sourceforge.net/projects/impro-visor/files/\n\n  You can see this message again by Help > Show First-Launch Message.\n

HelpDialog.CriticHelpPane.TabConstraints.tabToolTip=
HelpDialog.criticHelpTextArea.text=Help for Critic\n\nThe critic feature allows you to grade solos using a trained artificial neural \nnetwork, a machine learning technique loosely inspired by the human brain.\n\nNeural network critics can be trained using Impro-Visor or loaded from \nweight files (both using the "Neural Network Learning" tab of the Grammar\n Control Window, accessible via Utilities > Grammar). Note that these weight \nfiles are different than the Deep Learning connectomes, which, while also\n neural network weights, use a different format. Once a critic is loaded, it \ncan grade solos, generate solos above a certain grade (using grammars) and \nload several neural network critics in parallel to guess which musician would \nhave been most likely to play a given passage.\n\nTraining\n\nTo train the critic, you need a .training.data file of saved licks and grades to \nserve as examples for the neural network. One such file comes with \nImpro-Visor currently. Further training files can be generated from Grammar \nOptions > Show Critic Exporter at the top of the Grammar Control Window. \nIf the option just above it, "Send Licks to Critic" is selected, the "Lick Saving \nand Grading" panel will save a lick with label and grade. Licks saved here \nwill appear in the Critic Exporter window, where you can save them to \n.training.data files for neural network training.\n\nOnce you have a .training.data file, you can train a critic by going to the \n"Neural Network Learning" tab of the grammar controls. First, set up your\n neural network structure by adding and removing layers (with the add/remove \nlayer buttons) and changing the number of neurons and activation function in \neach layer (by double clicking on the relevant value). After your network is set \nup, click "Generate Weight File" to train the network and save the weights \nwith the name designated by the "weight file" field.\n\nLoading Weights\n\nIn order to use the critic feature, you have to load a generated weight file. \nOnce you have loaded a weight file, the "Melody Generator" tab of the Grammar \nControl Window changes to include the Critic Options panel.\n\nUsing the Critic to Grade\n\nFrom the Critic Options panel, you can grade a lick you have selected in the main \nImpro-Visor window. Grades are assigned by the neural network based on the \ntraining data used to generate the weight file. If you select less than the entire \npiece in the main window, you can use the "Step Forward" and "Step Backward" \nbuttons to move the selection forwards and backwards in the piece, and use the \n"Grade Selected Lick" and "Generate Better Lick" (described below) on only that \nselection. For example, if you have four bars selected, "Step Forward" will \nchange your selection to the next four bars instead. "Offset by Measure" allows \nyou to move your selection by exactly one measure instead. "Reset Selection" will \nundo all changes made to the selection range using the Critic Options panel.\n\nUsing the Critic to Generate Licks\n\nThe panel can also use the critic to generate licks (still using grammars, not any \nsort of deep learning) with better grades. When you push the "Generate Better Lick" \nbutton, the system will generate licks with the grammar selected in the main notate \nwindow until it produces one that scores above the threshold in the "Grade" box to \nthe left, and deposits the number of solos it generated and threw out because they \nwere below that threshold in the "Counter" box. If it takes too many samples, \nImpro-Visor will display an error message. The system also works without a threshold\nif the "Use Critic" box is unchecked. The "Correct All" button is equivalent to pressing \nthe "Generate Better Lick" button, then "Step Forwards" until the selection reaches \nthe end of the current chorus.\n\nGuess Musician Feature\n\nUnrelated to the Neural Network Learning interface, you can use the Lick Saving and \nGrading panel to identify which grading scheme a given passage scores best under, \nwhich can be used to guess the musician most likely to play that passage, if you have\nweights from training the neural network on pieces by that musician. To use this \nfeature, the vocab/style-recognition-weights folder in the Impro-Visor files directory\nmust contain a .weights.save file for each musician. These files do not come bundled\nwith Impro-Visor by default, you will have to either contact the developers or train \nthem yourself. If you do have these weight files, you can click "Prepare Critics" to set \nup several neural network critics in parallel. Once that happens, the button's text will \nchange to "Guess Musician", which you can press to identify which musician the \npassage selected in the main Impro-Visor window best resembles.

HelpDialog.customSoloGenerator.TabConstraints.tabTitle=Custom Theme Weaver
HelpDialog.customSoloGenInstructions.text=Help For The Custom Theme Weaver\n\nThe Custom Theme Weaver is a tool that can be used to construct a solo in a similar way\nthat the regular Theme Weaver does, but manually. You can create the solo piece by piece, \nmaking transformations and personalized edits as you please.\n\nStep 1: Choosing a Theme\n\nOn the left, there are a list of themes. To begin, you can choose the theme you want to use\nby clicking on it. Make sure the name of the theme is displayed at the top of the window where\nit says 'Chosen Theme:'. If you want to create your own theme, you can go into the regular Theme\nWeaver and follow the steps to use a selected melody from the leadsheet as a theme. Once \nyou name it, it will be available to use in the Custom Theme Weaver.\n\nStep 2: Choosing Transformations\n\nChoose the transformations you would like to apply by clicking the corresponding button. For\nsome transformations there are other options you need to choose, or else the default settings\nwill be used. You need to select the transformations you want to use in the order that you wish \nfor them to be used in. The order will be displayed beneath the transformation options.\n\nYou can revert the theme to its original form by pressing the 'Reset Choices' button.\n\nStep 3: Listen to the Adjusted Theme\n\nTo hear the changes you have made, click the 'Click To Play Theme' button.\n\nStep 4: Add Theme To the Solo\n\nFor this step, you have two options.\n\t\n\t1.

HelpDialog.deepLearningHelpTextArea.text=Help for Deep Learning\n\nThe Deep Learning Control Panel (Utilities > Deep Learning) allows you to configure the\nneural network used in the Deep Learning improvisation mode.\n\nLoading network parameters:\nTrained parameters are stored in connectome (.ctome) files. To load a specific connectome,\nclick the Load button on the bottom of the Deep Learning window, and select a connectome\nfile. Once you choose a file, it will be loaded into memory. This may take a few seconds, and\nthe Deep Learning improvisation mode will be disabled until the parameters are fully loaded.\n\nGeneration Settings:\nThe Deep Learning window contains a variety of settings that adjust the generation process.\n\n- Generation Mode\n        * In "Ahead of time" mode, the entire piece is generated before anything is played. This\n           is similar to other improvisation modes, but can take a long time due to the internal\n           deep learning calculations.\n        * In "Just in time" mode, the piece is generated in 4-bar segments. Playback begins as\n           soon as the network generates the first 4 bars, and generation continues in the\n           background. This makes the generation process much faster, but can cause playback\n           issues.\n\n- Risk Level\n        The Risk Level slider determines how often the network should play notes it considers\n        less plausible than other notes.\n        * With the slider in the center, the network will play notes according to its internal\n           model of note likelihood. This is the default.\n        * With the slider on the "Conservative" side, the network will avoid notes it considers\n           unlikely. This can produce more consonant melodies, but may have less nuance.\n        * With the slider on the "Adventurous" side, the network will choose unlikely notes\n           more often than otherwise. This can add nuance and variation, but may produce\n           dissonant notes or strange rhythms occasionally.\n\n- Expert Weighting\n        The Expert Weighting slider determines how the contour and pitch of the melody are\n        weighted. Specifically, the deep learning network uses two "experts", one in control\n        of intervals and the other in control of pitch relative to the chord progression. This\n        slider adjusts how the input of the experts is combined.\n        * With the slider in the center, the network weights each expert equally.\n        * With the slider on the "Contour" side, the network favors the advice of the interval\n           expert over the chord expert. This may produce smoother contours at the expense\n           of dissonance.\n        * With the slider on the "Pitch" side, the network favors the advice of the chord expert\n           over the interval expert. This may produce more consonant notes at the expense of\n           jagged contours.\n\n- Rest Limiting\n        Occasionally, the trained network may output long stretches of rest. The Rest Limiting\n        checkboxes determine how to handle these long rests.\n        * With "Don't limit rests" checked, the network is fully in control of the length of rests.\n        * With "Force network to play a note after long rest" checked, after a long rest the network\n           is forced to pick a note without being allowed to continue resting.\n        * With "Reset network on next bar after long rest" checked, after a long rest the network\n           memory is wiped and it starts generation from a clean state. This can allow the network\n           to recover from undesired behaviors, but does not always work as well.\n        If the second or third boxes are checked, the length of a "long rest" is determined by the\n        selection box "Rest limit length".\n\n- Rectification\n        The rectification options allow rectification to be performed to the network output by\n        imposing constraints on the notes that the network can output.\n        * The "Rectify network output" checkbox, if checked, prohibits the network from choosing\n           notes that do not fit in the current chord. If the "Allow color tones" checkbox is also\n           checked, the network can choose either chord tones or color tones.\n        * The "Merge repeated pitches" checkbox, if checked, prevents the network from articulating\n           the same pitch multiple times in a row. If the network would choose to do this, the\n           previous note is sustained instead.\n\nTraining the network:\nThe training process for the deep learning network parameters is computationally expensive\nand mathematically complex. As such, the training functionality is not directly available in\nImpro-Visor. Additional connectomes can be trained using the lstmprovisor-python project,\navailable at https://github.com/Impro-Visor/lstmprovisor-python.

HelpDialog.drawingHelpPane.TabConstraints.tabTitle=Drawing
HelpDialog.drawingHelp.text=Help for Using the Draw (pencil) Tool\n\nThe Draw (pencil) tool allows you to input notes quickly by dragging the \nmouse continuously over the stave.  This makes it easy to sketch out \nthe 'melody contour' of your solo fluidly, without having to click at each\nindividual space.\n\nNote Fitting\n\nThe Draw tool does its best to fit notes along the curve you draw.  That is,\nit will add the pitch that roughly correponds to the stave note under\nthe cursor.  Since a melody contour defines the shape of the pitches\nin the music - but not necessarily specific pitches - the Draw tool allows\nyou to ignore harmonic rules when sketching out this shape; it will match\npitches to the nearest harmonious ones, for the current chord.  When\nno chord ("NC") is in effect, the Draw tool fits notes using the major\nscale of the score's key.\n\nNote Duration\n\nThe duration of notes on the drawn contour is determined by the note-\nspacing you can set below each measure.  If you want a triplet, for \nexample, in a particular measure, you can simply set the rhythm there\n(by dragging out the note spacing) and draw over that measure.  Notes\nwill automatically be fitted along the curve you draw, to that rhythm.\n\nDrawing Tips\n\n   * You can extend a note while drawing by holding the Shift key.  This\n     will 'flatline' the melody contour and increase the duration of the\n     current note being drawn. \n\n   * To add rest while drawing, you can hold the Control key.  Drawing\n     over the stave with Control down will insert rest there.  You may\n     also press 'R' while a given note is selected to insert rest there.\n\n   * When drawing over chord changes, you may want to force a tone\n     that 'approaches' the change before a given chord.  By holding\n     Shift-A, the Draw tool will always add an approach tone before a\n     chord change, and then resolve to the nearest chord tone.\n\n   * If you draw too quickly, the tool might "miss" a note, and not fit\n     it to the curve right away.  Don't panic!  Any notes that aren't fitted\n     properly will conform to the curve once you release the mouse button.\n\n   * Post-edit!  If you want to change a note or two, edit them after you\n     finish sketching.  Adjusting the pitch is easy; just drag up and down\n     on a note.  Using the keyboard controls, it's also easy to add rest\n     or extend notes afterwards.\n\n   * Want to hear the notes as they're being drawn?  Unmute the entry\n     sounds on the mixer, and Impro-Visor will remember your \n     preference during this session.  If you always want to hear them\n     by default, you may toggle the default settings under \n     "Preferences -> Contour Drawing".\n\n   * Maybe you only want the Draw tool to add chord tones or color\n     tones, rather than all scale tones.  Impro-Visor allows you to \n     set the Draw tool pitches under "Preferences -> Contour Drawing".\n
HelpDialog.fractalHelpPane.TabConstraints.tabTitle=Division
HelpDialog.fractalHelpPane.TabConstraints.tabToolTip=
HelpDialog.fractalHelpTextArea.text=Help for Division\n\nDivision can be applied over any existing melody.\nHowever, it works best with a compound guide tone line.\nIt uses the probabilities for a given note to decide whether\nit will split the note, leave it as is, or turn it into a rest. It does\nthis for every note in the current leadsheet and adds a new chorus with\nthe result to the open leadsheet.\n\nIn the Division window, there are three types of probabilties that can\nbe changed. For every value that can be set, it should stay in the range\nbetween 0 and 1. The closer to 1 it is, the more likely that an event\nwill happen. \n\n- Division probabilities:\n\t* These are the probabilities that a note will be divided into\n\t  multiple notes of shorter durations. \n\t* Example: whole note has a probability of 0.85 so 85% of the time\n\t  a whole note will be split into shorter notes\n\t* A different probability can be set for each length of note listed\n\t* If a note is not a length that is listed, it will use the default\n\t  value \n\n- Rest probabilities: \n\t* These are the probabilities that a note will be turned into a rest\n\t  of the same duration\n\t* Example: whole note has a probability of 0.05 so 5% of the time\n\t  a whole note will turn into a whole rest\n\t* The default value is used for any note that is not a duration\n\t  that is listed\n\n- Ways to divide:\n\t* These are the probabilities that determine when a note will be split\n\t  into a duplet or triplet\n\t* You can set the triplet probability and the duplet value will be \n\t  adjusted accordingly when you press enter\n\t* Example: if you set triplet probabilitiy to 0.3, the duplet\n\t  probability will change to 0.7. Then, 30% of the time a note is split,\n\t  it will be split into a triplet and 70% of the time it will only be\n\t  split into two notes.\n\nBelow the probabilities, you can set a value of how many times a line will\nbe divided at once. To use this, you set the value you want and then click \ndivide multiple times. It is recommended to only divide a line 3-4 times, \nbut the results can vary based on how complex the line you started with was.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to see how a line can change after each iteration,\nyou can divide it one time, and repeat this process multiple times, each \ntime a new chorus is added with the result.

HelpDialog.guideToneHelpTextArea.text=Help for Guide Tone Lines\n\nGenerating a guide tone line creates a basic melody that can be used as\na basis for improvisation. It creates a line of mostly chord tones that\nhighlight the chord it is being played over. It is a way to start\ngiving shape to a melody based on the chord progression. \n\nTo generate a line from the guide line window:\n\n- Choose either one or two lines\n\t* One line will generate one guide tone line\n\t* Two lines will generate two guide tone lines that alternate\n\n- Choose a direction for the line to follow\n\t* No preference will not have a guiding direction\n\t* Ascending will create a line that is generally moving up\n\t* Descending will create a line that is generally moving down\n\n- For one line:\n   Choose a scale degree to start on\n\t* It is recommended to choose either 3 or 7 if those notes are in \n\t  the first chord\n\t* Can only be used when generating one line\n\n- For two lines:\n   Choose the type of line to create\n  \t* 3-7 line will have the first line start on the 3 of the chord and\n  \t  the second line will start on the 7 of the chord\n  \t* 7-3 line starts on the 7 instead\n  \t* 5-9 line will have the first line start on the 5 of the chord and \n  \t  the second line will start on the 7 of the chord\n  \t* 9-5 line starts on the 9 instead\n\n- Choose a max note duration\n\t* No preference will create a line where each chord has one or two\n\t  notes as guide tones, depending on the number of lines chosen.\n\t* Whole will fill the guide tone line with whole notes. If a chord\n\t  lasts longer than a whole note, it will split that chord into\n\t  two guide tones. \n\t* Half will act similarly to whole, but with half notes\n\t* Quarter will act similarly with quarter notes\n\t* Choosing any option other than no preference will add color tones\n\t  to the line if necessary\n\n- Choose a range for the guide tone line\n\t* On the keyboard, click the two keys that correspond to the high and\n\t  low limit for the preferred range. Once a key is clicked, it will \n\t  turn green\n\t* If two keys are already selected, one must be unselected by clicking\n\t  on it again in order to choose a new note\n\t* The default range is the octave from middle C to the C above it\n\t  (C4 to C5)\n\t* If no keys or only one key is selected, the default range will be\n\t  used.\n\t* The blue keys cannot be selected for a range because those notes\n\t  cannot be displayed in a leadsheet. If these are selected, the \n\t  default range will be used. \n\t* If a range smaller than an octave is selected, the default range \n\t  will be used.\n\nOnce a line is generated, you can improvise over it using the Generate\nSolo Over Line button. This uses transformations applied to the guide\ntone line to create an improvised melody.

HelpDialog.lickGenSettingsPane.TabConstraints.tabTitle=Lick Generator
HelpDialog.lickGenSettings.text=Help for the Lick Generator\n\nThe lick generator and triage tool is a powerful and customizable\nutility that will create original licks over a given series of chord\nchanges.\n\nThe lick generator creates things in two steps; first, it generates\na rhythm using a context-free grammar.  Then, it fills in this\nrhythm probabilistically.  This allows for a large variety of \ndifferent melodys.  The grammar is specified in the text field under\n"Grammar File."  This file is customizable and uses the following\nformat for terminal values:\n\n<Note type><Value>\n\nNote type can be one of\n     * X - any note\n     * R - a rest\n     * C - a chord tone (as specified in the vocabulary file)\n     * L - a color tone (as specified in the vocabulary file)\n     * S - a scale tone (as specified by the user.  If "None" is chosen, \n\tthis is ignored.  If use first scale is chosen, it looks\n\tat the first scale in the vocabulary file associated \n\twith the given chord.  If there is no such scale, this\n\tis ignored).\n     * A - an approach tone (forces the following note to be a\n \tchord tone, and approaches from a half step\n\tabove or below).\n\nValue can be from 1 (4 beats) to 16/3 (sixteenth note triplets).  \nLonger note values are not currently supported in the grammar.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of how to modify the grammar\nfile, please see the "Lick Generator" tutorial.\n\nA few notes on parameter setting in grammars:\nThe expectancy for the generated line is calculated as \n(expectancy-multiplier)(expectancy value of previous line) + \n(normalized expectancy-constant (where 1 is the highest value)). \nA higher expectancy value means more highly expected notes will show up \nin the generated line.\nWhile this gives many options for expectancies, most users will not find\na use for expectancy-multiplier that is not 1 or 0 (i.e. follows the user or\nuses a constant expectancy value).\nExpectancy-constant can range from 0 to 1 but a pretty normal value for\nthis is around a 0.6 to 0.7\n\nThe syncopation-multiplier and syncopation-constant work in exactly \nthe same way but a typical value for syncopation-constant is around 0.15\n\nIf you do not wish to use the context-free grammar to generate a\nrhythm, deselect the "Use Grammar" button.  This tends to create\nless listenable fragments, however.\n\nBy default, the lick generator will tend to avoid repeating the same\nnote multiple times in a row.  If you would like to turn this off,\ndeselect the "Avoid Repeat Pitch" button.\n\n"Generate" creates a rhythm and fills it in using the probabilities.\n\n"Generate Rhythm" only creates a rhythm.\n\n"Fill Melody" generates a melody for a given rhythm (the rhythm\nis specified in the large text box; note that you can manually enter\nlonger note values here using leadsheet notation, as in X2+4 for\na three beat note)\n\n"Get Selected Rhythm" will read the rhythmic pattern of whatever\nis currently selected.\n\n"Replay" replays the current selection.\n\n"Help" displays this dialog.\n\n"Reload" will re-parse the grammar file.\n\n"Save Lick" saves the lick into the vocabulary.\n\nThe lick generator will automatically determine note probabilities \nfor all chords in the from the current selection start up to the\ntotal number of beats specified.  If you would like to disable this\nfeature, deselect the "Auto-fill probabilities" check box.  The\n"Fill" button will reset them to their defaults, and the "Clear" button\nsets them all to zero.\n\nOther options:\n     * Min/Max Pitch: Do not use pitches higher or lower than these\n\tvalues.\n\n     * Min/Max Interval: Do not jump higher or lower than this interval\n\tunless a jump probability is set.\n\n     * Min/Max Duration (only used if the grammar is disabled): Do\n\tnot generate notes with rhythmic values longer or\n\tshorter than these; note that these are inverse, so\n\t32 indicates a 32nd note and 1 indicates a whole note.\n\n     * Beats: The length of the lick to generate in beats.  This value is \n\tbased off of the current selection.\n\n     * Rest Probability (only used if the grammar is disabled): The\n\tprobability of a given note being a rest.\n\n     * Leap Probability: The probability of jumping outside the\n\tmaximum interval (see above).

HelpDialog.roadmapHelpPane.TabConstraints.tabTitle=Roadmap
HelpDialog.roadmapHelp.text=Help for Using the Roadmap Mode\n\nUsing Roadmaps\n\nRoadmaps allow for viewing and manipulation of a leadsheet from a larger\nperspective, focused on the chord progressions that make up a given song.\nUsing a roadmap makes it fast and easy to move and transpose whole chords\nand chord sequences, and to visualize the structure of a song in terms of\n"bricks", or common chord sequences used to construct jazz tunes.\n\nOpening a Roadmap\n\nWhen you wish to open a road map, you have a choice of how it will open:\n\n   * if you only want an empty roadmap, you can type Ctrl-';' to open a\n     roadmap describing a blank leadsheet.\n\n   * if you want a roadmap containing the chords of the song you have\n     open, press ';' and a roadmap will open with all the chords from \n     the currently active leadsheet. \n\n   * if you want a roadmap with your current song, but converted into\n     bricks, press Shift-';' and a roadmap will generate containing the\n     chords of the current leadsheet grouped together as chord bricks.\n\nAll of these options are also available by opening the Roadmap menu on a \nleadsheet.\n\nIf you want a roadmap to open whenever you open a leadsheet, you can go to\nthe Roadmap menu and click "Generate roadmap on Opening Leadsheet" to enable the\nsetting. When this option is checked, any time a leadsheet is opened a \ncorresponding roadmap will open with the chords grouped into bricks.\n\nWhen a roadmap is open, you can use the File -> Open Leadsheet option to\nselect a different leadsheet to roadmap. Alternately, if you want to navigate\nthrough a series of files in one directory, you can use the arrows just below\nthe File menu to step back and forth between roadmaps based on alphabetical \nordering of the leadsheet file names.\n\nIf you have modified a roadmap and wish to convert it back into an appropriate\nleadsheet, you can use the Leadsheet menu to either put the selected chords \n(or all the chords if none are selected) into a new leadsheet or append them to\nthe current leadsheet.\n\n \nReading a Roadmap\n\nIn the primary pane of a roadmap window, you can see a graphical representation \nof the chords from an opened leadsheet (or no chords at all). The chords will\nbe displayed as a list of "blocks": either individual chords or chords grouped\ntogether into "bricks".\n\nThere are three levels to a road map: the key level, the block level, and the \nchord level. At the top level is a color-coded key map, which shows the general\nkey at a certain point in a tune. The coloration is based upon position around\nthe circle of fifths; the nearer two colors are in the spectrum, the closer they\nare in the circle of fifths. If the key is minor or dominant rather than major,\nit takes the color of its relative major counterpart. If you don't like the \ncoloration, you can always go to File -> Roadmap Information and uncheck "Key\nColoration".\n\nNext, at the block level, one can see the names of any bricks present. An \nunanalyzed piece will have no names here, as everything will be broken into\nchords. When analyzed, the names of bricks grouping these chords together \nwill appear in the middle bar if any such grouping exists. If a brick overlaps\nanother brick, a "+ ..." will appear. If insufficient space exists to display\nthe brick's full name, you'll just see a "...". To see the full name, mouse \nover the brick.\n\nFinally, the chords themselves are shown at the bottom level with their durations.\nThese can be any chords accepted by Impro-Visor itself, and will usually be pulled\nfrom the leadsheet open in Impro-Visor's main window.\n\nSometimes, below the end of a brick, a yellow box with a word will appear. This\ndescribes the kind of "join" that exists between two blocks. Joins are named \nbased upon the interval between the key of two blocks:a Homer joins two bricks \nin the same key, a Cherokee joins two bricks with the second a half-step up from\nthe first, , a Woody joins two bricks a whole step apart, etc. The list of all \njoins in order based on number of half-steps up the second key is from the\nfirst key is: \n         0: Homer (same key)           6:  Stella (tritone)\n         1: Cherokee (half step up)    7:  Backslider (fourth down)\n         2: Woody (whole step up)      8:  Half Nelson (major third down)\n         3: Highjump (minor third up)  9:  Sidewinder (minor third down)\n         4: Bauble (major third up)    10: New Horizon (whole step down)\n         5: Bootstrap (fourth up)      11: Downwinder (half step down)\n\nThese joins will only appear between a brick ending in a stable chord and a \nbrick beginning in an unstable chord, so don't be surprised if there are\nnot joins between all bricks.\n\nEnds of blocks will sometimes have a doubled line. This indicates that the\nblock is the end of a section (two thick lines) or a phrase (a thin line and a\nthick line). Sections and phrases are notated in a leadsheet file with the \nparenthetical expressions \n  (section (style = [style name]))\nand\n  (phrase)\nrespectively. These help both to display the roadmap in a way that keeps\nsections distinct and to keep analysis from making bricks that overlap two\nsections or phrases.\n\nIf you wish to change the width of the contents of the roadmap, you can use\nthe Feature Width slider on the top toolbar to make the contents more easily\nviewable. If brick names are difficult to view due to the feature width, you\ncan mouse over difficult-to-view bricks and the full name will show.\n\n\nBrick Dictionary\n\nThe Brick Dictionary contains a list of possible bricks for you to use in\na given piece. This also is the list of possible bricks that could appear in\nthe analyzed version of a piece. Each brick has a type which describes the\npurpose that brick serves in a given piece: sometimes, a "Cadence", for \ninstance, starts from an unresolved chord and progresses to a resolution.\n\nYou can select a brick in the dictionary by navigating through the tree, first\nlooking for the type, then the brick name. Sometimes, a brick will have several\nvariants; in this case, you can either select the folder with that name to get\nthe default, or you can open the folder to view one of the brick variants.\n\nWhen a brick is selected, it displays in the Brick Preview pane as it would if\nit were inserted into the roadmap. From there, one can use the drop-down menus\nbelow the dictionary to select the key of a given brick or the relative duration\nof the brick. When one is satisfied with the appearance of a given brick, one \ncan drag it from the brick preview pane to the desired location in the current \nroadmap to insert it.\n\nIf you don't want to see a brick in the library or on the roadmap, you can \nselect the brick in the tree and then press the "Delete Selected Library Brick"\nbutton. This will take the brick out of the visible library. Careful when you\ndelete a brick, though: if you want to restore it in the dictionary, you will\nneed to open the BrickDictionary.txt file in the "vocab" folder of the \nImpro-Visor application, find the definition, and change the word "Invisible"\nback to the correct brick type.\n\n\nManipulating the Roadmap\n\nIn order to change either parts or the entirety of the roadmap, you have to \nselect the parts of the roadmap you wish to change. You can select these parts\nby clicking on them. To select a single block, click on it. To select multiple,\nclick on the starting block, then hold Shift and click on the ending block. All\nthe blocks from the first to the second will be selected. If you wish to select\nthe entire leadsheet, type "A" or click "Select All" in the Edit menu..\n\nWhen you have a selection, you can perform several transformations on the \nselected block(s):\n\n   * To transpose the key up a semitone, press "E"; to transpose it down a \n     semitone, press "D".\n\n   * You can change the duration of a given selection by selecting the "Scale\n     Duration" menu in the top toolbar. It will scale the selection to the \n     given fraction or multiple of the current duration.\n\n   * You can cut or copy a set of chords by pressing "X" or "C", respectively.\n     These can then be pasted before a selection (or at the end of the chord\n     sequence if there is no selection) by typing "V" later. These operations \n     are also all available in the Edit menu.\n\n   * To delete the selection, press the Delete/Backspace key. You can also\n     delete selections from the Edit menu.\n\n   * You can undo a modification by pressing "Z". If you wish to redo the \n     operation, pressing "Y" will return the roadmap to the state before the\n     undo. These operations are also available in the Edit menu.\n\n   * You can modify a particular chord by clicking on the chord name itself\n     within a selection. If you double-click the chord, you can change its name\n     and duration. Only valid chord names will be accepted. Changing a chord in\n     a brick will break the brick up.\n\n   * To "break" a selection into the blocks that make it up, click on the \n     "Break" button in the top toolbar, or select "Break Selection" in the \n    Edit menu. \n\n   * To "flatten" a selection into the chords that make it up, click on the\n     "Flatten button in the top toolbar, or select "Flatten Selection" in the\n     Edit menu.\n\n   * To add a selection as a new brick in the Brick Library, click the "New\n     Brick" button in the top toolbar. This will open a dialog window where you\n     can name the brick and select its key, type, and mode.\n\n   * One of the most useful tools in the roadmap is the Analyze button, which \n     will take the whole piece or a selection and split it into the best \n     combination of bricks it can find. Generally, this will take a few seconds,\n     so be patient. If you aren't happy with the resulting bricks, try taking \n     selections from what you want to analyze and analyzing them individually,\n     or redefining where section divisions are in the roadmap.\n\n   * To change whether or not a given selection ends a section, you can type\n     Return or click "Toggle Section" in the Section menu. Alternatively, if you\n     wish for the selection to be the end of a phrase, you can type Shift+Return\n     or click "Toggle Phrase" in the Section menu. A brick can end either a \n     section or a phrase, but not both.\n\nAdditionally, the Roadmap supports playback of a given selection. If you press\nthe "play" button (the triangle on the top toolbar), a MIDI matching the chords\nfor a given section and the style on the leadsheet will play. Hitting the "stop"\nbutton (the square on the top toolbar) will stop playback, and one can toggle\nwhether the playback will loop or not by clicking the "Loop" button on the top\ntoolbar. If nothing is selected, playback will default to the whole of the tune.\n\n\n

HelpDialog.soloGenInstructions.text=Help for the Theme Weaver\n\nThe Theme Weaver is a tool that can be used to generate solos by using one \nor multiple 'themes' and the generated solo style or player the user has chosen.\nIn addition to some pre-entered themes and generating a theme, you can also write \nyour own and save them for later use. The Theme Weaver takes in seven weighted \nvalues (or probabilities). The first determines whether a theme will be used. If it used, \nit then decides if it will be transformed in six different ways: transposed, inverted, \nreversed, expanded, side slipped, or bar line shifted. If a theme is not used, the\nspace in the solo will be filled with a melody based on the chosen style or player in \nthe main window. The user can experiment with different values and themes to find \nwhat works best. The table acts as their workspace.\n\n\nHighlighting a Cell\n\nThere are two ways to highlight a cell: \n\t* Click once on the cell \nOr if you have just entered something into the cell: \n\t* Press 'Enter'\n\nYou will know your cell is highlighted if it is blue.\n \n\nGenerating a Theme\n\n\t1. Type in an integer for the length of the theme, such as '6'\n\t    or '7' into a cell in the 'Length' labeled column. The length \n\t    represents the number of beats in the generated theme.\t\n\n\t2. Make sure after each length you type in, you press 'Enter' or \n\t    click out of the cell. \n\n\t3. Click the button 'Generate Theme'.\n\nA theme in leadsheet notation should appear in the Theme cell(s) to the right \nof the Length cell(s) you chose. \n\nIf you have already generated several themes and you only want to change one \nof them, highlight the Length cell of the theme you want to change and then \nclock the button 'Generate Theme' and only the theme for that highlighted \ncell will change. \n\n\nThemes Scroll Box \n\nTo the right of the table, there is a scroll box labeled 'Themes'. This is where\nyour saved themes will appear. If you want to use one of the themes in the scroll \nbox, make sure to click anywhere in the Solo Generator window, then click \nthe theme you desire in the scroll box. The theme will appear in the first empty \nrow in the table along with its corresponding name and theme length in the name \nand length cells to the left of it.\n\nIf you click a click a theme more than once so it will appear in the table multiple \ntimes, it will appear in the table labeled with a number representing what number\ncopy it is, such as 'Jingle Bells - 1,'' and will be added and saved to the Themes Scroll Box. \n\nIf you want to hear a theme in the scroll box to decide if you want to use it, \npress the 'Shift' key and hold it down, then click the theme you want to hear. \n\nIf you want to delete a theme, select the theme you wish to be deleted, then \nclick the 'Delete Theme From File' button. \n\n\nListening to a Theme in the Table \n\nIf you want to listen to a theme that it is in your table, press the 'Shift' key \nand hold it down, then click any cell in the row of the theme you want to hear. \n\n\nGenerating a Solo\n\n \t* Make sure that for every theme in your table, the 'Use', 'Transpose', \n\t  'Invert', 'Reverse', 'Expand', 'Side Slip', and 'Bar Line Shift' cells are all \n\t   filled in with weighted values from 0 to 1, as well as the 'Theme Prob' \n\t   text field, representing how much you want the theme to be used, t\n\t   ransposed, inverted, reversed, expanded, side slipped, bar line shifted \n\t   or not used at all. \n\n\t* Make sure after every value you type in, you press 'Enter' \n\t  or click out of the cell to ensure the value has been entered. \n\n\t* Make sure the 'Theme Use Interval' text field is filled in with an \n\t   integer that represents the length of the intervals that the solo\n          \t   will be broken up into.\n        \n\t* Then click the button 'Generate Solo'. \n\nA solo will appear in your open leadsheet and will be played. \n\n\nGenerate Solo Scroll Box \n\nAfter you generate a solo, in the empty scroll box beneath the table, you will see the \nname of the theme used in the solo and whether it was transposed, inverted, reversed,\nexpanded, side slipped, or bar line shifted.\nIf the theme has no name, it will appear as 'null'.  If the name \nof the theme is not transformed, 'unmodified' will appear after the name.\n\n\nNaming\n \nAfter adding a theme you have generated or typed in yourself to the dictionary\nof themes in the Themes scroll box to the right of the table, you have \nto name it. The first column of the table is the "Name" column as shown \nby the label at the top. \n\n\t1. Double-click the name cell in the row of the theme you want\n\t    to save.\n\n\t2. Then type in the name of your choice and then either  \n\t\t*  press 'Enter' or\n\t\t*  click out of the cell.\n\nThe name will appear in the Themes scroll box at the bottom.  \n\n\nUsing Leadsheet Selections as Themes\n\nIf there is a string of notes already in the leadsheet that you want to use -  \n\n\t1. Click where the section starts then drag over the section until\n\t    all the notes you want are highlighted.\n\n\t2. Click the button 'Use Current Selection in Leadsheet Window as Theme'.  \n\nThe theme should appear in the first empty row in the table with its corresponding \nlength in the length cell to the left of it.\n\nTransformation Order\n\nAs you can imagine, the order that the transformations are executed in will change \nthe final product. In the middle of the window, you can choose the transformation \norder. Enter the desired order from top to bottom. You cannot enter the same \ntransformation twice. \n\nRange\n\nTo set the range of the whole solo, press the 'Choose Range' button. \n\nEditing Themes\n\nIf you want, you can make your own edits to current themes in your table. \nOnce you press 'Enter' or click out of the cell, the theme length integer in \nthe length cell will change accordingly. \n\n\nEditing Table Items\n\n\t* To clear the entire table and restore any rows you deleted, click the 'Reset' button.\n\n\t* To delete a whole row, highlight any cell in the row you want to delete and press\n\t   the "Delete" button on your keyboard or click the 'Delete Selected Row' button \n\t   below the table.\n\n\t* To enter in probabilities of using the theme, transposing, inverting, etc. faster, you\n\t  can set all the probabilities equal to the first theme. Once you\u2019ve entered your \n\t  desired probabilities in the first row, click 'Set All Probabilities Equal To 1st Theme'.\n\n\t* To reset all the probabilities to zero, press 'Reset Theme Probabilities To Zero'.\n\n\t* To set all the theme probabilities to the same value, enter the desired probability\n\t   in the text area at the bottom and press the 'Set Probabilities' button. \n\nTransformation Preferences\n\nThere are separate preferences windows for the expand, side slip, and bar line shift \ntransformations. To open these windows, press the 'Open Transformation Preferences'\nbutton (where Transformation is the corresponding desired transformation).\n\n\nPlaying\n\n\t* To stop playing a solo, click the 'Stop Playing' button. Once you click it, you will \n\t   see the button change to saying 'Play Solo'\n\n\t* To play the solo you have stopped click the 'Play Solo' button. Once you click it, it\n           will switch back to saying 'Stop Playing'
HelpDialog.styleHelpList1.text=Help for Style Notation\n\nStyles are responsible for Impro-Visor's playback accompaniment.  Styles \nare specified in the vocabulary file as a set of patterns for each instrument\nof the accompaniment.  There are also style parameters that determine how\nthe patterns are used.\n\nPatterns\n\nEach pattern is defined by a set of rules.  The rules are similar to\nleadsheet notation, except the pitch is replaced with a capital letter\nindicating the rule.  Each pattern also has a weight that determines how\noften that pattern is used in relation to other patterns of the same length.\n\nChord Patterns\n\nChord patterns determine only the rhythm of the chord accompaniment. (The \nvoicings to use are decided based on a voice-leading algorithm.)\n\nChord patterns use the following rules:\n\nX       Strike the chord\nR       A rest\n\nBass Patterns\n\nBass patterns determine both the rhythm of the bassline and the type of\nnotes that are chosen.\n\nBass patterns use the following rules, where d is a duration, such as\n4 for a quarter-note, 8 for an eighth-note, etc.\n\nBd      The bass note (either the root of the chord, or the note specified\n        as part of a slash chord)\n\nCd      A note from the current chord\n\nSd      A note from the first scale associated with the current chord\n\nAd      A tone that approaches the bass note of the next chord\n\nNd      The bass note of the next chord (if at the end of a pattern\n        it will tie over to the next pattern)\n\nRd      A rest of duration d\n\n=d      The same note as the previous note, ignoring rests.\n\n(X n d) A specific note from the first scale given for a chord in\n        the vocabulary. For example (X 5 4) will give a quarter-note\n        on the fifth-degree of the scale.\n\n(X bn d) or (X #n d)\n        A specific note from the first scale given for a chord in\n        the vocabulary, lowered or raised a half step using standard\n        flat/sharp notation.  For example (X b5 4) will give a\n        quarter-note on a half step below the fifth-degree of the scale.\n\nU/D notation\n        When inputting multiple notes into a bass pattern, placing\n        U or D between notes will guarantee a rise or drop from the\n        first note to the next.  For example, B4 U C4 D (X 2 4)\n        will give a bass note, followed by an ascending color tone,\n        followed by a descending second-degree note.       \n\n\nDrum Patterns\n\nDrum patterns are a bit more complicated in that for one pattern you must\nspecify a drum "rule" for each drum you want in the pattern.  Here is the\nformat for a drum rule specification:\n\n(drum DRUM-MIDI-NUMBER RULE RULE ...)\n\nDrum patterns use the following rules:\n\nX       Strike the drum\nR       A rest\n\nGeneral MIDI Drum Numbers:\n\n35      Acoustic Bass Drum      59      Ride Cymbal 2\n36      Bass Drum 1             60      Hi Bongo\n37      Side Stick              61      Low Bongo\n38      Acoustic Snare          62      Mute Hi Conga\n39      Hand Clap               63      Open Hi Conga\n40      Electric Snare          64      Low Conga\n41      Low Floor Tom           65      High Timbale\n42      Closed Hi-Hat           66      Low Timbale\n43      High Floor Tom          67      High Agogo\n44      Pedal Hi-Hat            68      Low Agogo\n45      Low Tom                 69      Cabasa\n46      Open Hi-Hat             70      Maracas\n47      Low-Mid Tom             71      Short Whistle\n48      Hi-Mid Tom              72      Long Whistle\n49      Crash Cymbal 1          73      Short Guiro\n50      High Tom                74      Long Guiro\n51      Ride Cymbal 1           75      Claves\n52      Chinese Cymbal          76      Hi Wood Block\n53      Ride Bell               77      Low Wood Block\n54      Tambourine              78      Mute Cuica\n55      Splash Cymbal           79      Open Cuica\n56      Cowbell                 80      Mute Triangle\n57      Crash Cymbal 2          81      Open Triangle\n58      Vibraslap\n\nStyle Parameters\n\nname            The name of the style\nswing           The swing value for the style\ncomp-swing\tThe swing value for the accompaniment parts of the style\nbass-high       The highest note in the bass's range\nbass-low        The lowest note in the bass's range\nbass-base       A note that specifies the starting area for the bassline\nchord-high      The highest note in the chord's range\nchord-low       The lowest note in the chord's range\nvoicing-type    Sets the voicing type to be used\n\nExample Style\n\n(style\n    (name swing)\n    (swing 0.67)\n    (comp-swing 0.67)\n    \n    (bass-high g-)\n    (bass-low g---)\n    (bass-base c--)\n    \n    (bass-pattern (rules B4 S4 C4 A4) (weight 10))\n    (bass-pattern (rules B4 C4 C4 A4) (weight 5))\n    (bass-pattern (rules B4 S4 C4 S4) (weight 3))\n    (bass-pattern (rules B4 S4 C4 A8 A8) (weight 3))\n    (bass-pattern (rules B4 S4 C4 S8 A8) (weight 3))\n    (bass-pattern (rules B4 C4) (weight 5))\n    (bass-pattern (rules B4 C8 A8) (weight 5))\n    (bass-pattern (rules B4 S4) (weight 3))\n    (bass-pattern (rules B4) (weight 5))\n    (bass-pattern (rules B4 A4) (weight 2))\n    \n    (drum-pattern\n        (drum 51 X4 X8 X8 X4 X8 X8)\n        (weight 10)\n        )\n    (drum-pattern\n        (drum 51 X4 X8 X8)\n        (weight 10)\n        )\n    (drum-pattern\n        (drum 51 X4)\n        (weight 10)\n        )\n        \n    (voicing-type closed)\n    (chord-high a)\n    (chord-low c-)\n    \n    (chord-pattern (rules X1) (weight 7))\n    (chord-pattern (rules X2) (weight 7))\n    (chord-pattern (rules X4) (weight 7))\n    (chord-pattern (rules X2+4 X4) (weight 5))\n    (chord-pattern (rules X4 R2+4) (weight 5))\n    (chord-pattern (rules X2 R2) (weight 7))\n    (chord-pattern (rules R4) (weight 1))\n    (chord-pattern (rules R8 X8+4 X4 R4) (weight 3))\n    (chord-pattern (rules R4 X8+4 X8 R4) (weight 5))\n    (chord-pattern (rules X8+2 X4 X8) (weight 2))\n    )\n\nStyle Tips\n\n   * The lengths of the patterns are important.  The software will attempt\n     to fill space with the largest pattern it can.  Try to correspond pattern\n     lengths to the probable chord durations.  If chords will mostly last for\n     4 beats, then have a 4 beat pattern.  If chords will last for 8 beats,\n     the software can fill that in with two 4 beat patterns.  Having a 1 beat\n     pattern for each accompaniment instrument is a good idea as a failsafe\n     for unconventional chord durations.\n\n   * Adding the parameter (no-style) to your style will cause the software\n     to leave out any bassline or drum part and play chords exactly where \n     they are specified on the leadsheet.\n\n   * Look to the styles included in the vocabulary file as a guide to\n     creating your own styles.\n\n   * Don't be afraid to experiment, but also don't be afraid to keep \n     things simple.\n

HelpDialog.transformHelpTextArea.text=Help for Transforms\n\nSuggestions for using:\nFor use on already moving solos:\n- Open a Transform file\n- Since the solo already has color in it, only select the embellishments to add\n- Make sure an identity substitution, or one that makes no change, is selected and has a high weight\n- Transform the solo\n\nFor use on very basic chordal outlines:\n- Open a Transform file\n- Select all the substitutions you want to have applied, the more the better\n- It is suggested to have the motif identity substitution have a low weight and the embellishment\n   identity substitution have a high weight\n- Transform the outline. \n\nSaving and Changing:\nTransforms are not automatically saved when changed. When a new transform is opened over a \ntransform with unsaved changes, the program will prompt you to save. If the application is being \nclosed however, unsaved changes will be lost, so be sure to save transforms regularly while editing.\n\nTransforms\n\nThe Transform tool can be used to take basic melodies, or chordal outlines, and complicate them by \ntransforming in common jazz idioms. These idioms that transform uses are defined from a \ntransformational grammar built into Impro-Visor. A transform is just a list of substitutions to be \napplied to a selected melody. \n\nThe proccess of applying a transform and each further grammar structure is described at the bottom \nof the help document. \n\nGUI:\nSince a transform is just a list of transforms, the list on the lower left of the panel shows all of the \nsubstitutions in the currently opened transform. \n\nSubstitutions\n\n\tSubstitutions are a wrapper for transformations, which are explained further down, and \n\tare used to group them. They can be used to represent all implementations of an idiom, \n\tmaking it the representation for an idiom in whole for the grammar. There are four \n\tdifferent parts to a substitution.\n\n\tSubstitution Parts:\n\t* name \t\t\t- The name that displays for the substitution in the list, for easy \n\t\t\t   \t   identification. Cannot have spaces\n\t* type\t\t\t- There are two types of substitutions, motifs and embellishments. \n\t\t\t   \t   They are described more below, but each idiom has to be either \n\t\t\t  \t   of the two and they determine when a substitution is attempted \n\t\t\t  \t   to be applied to a melody. \n\t* weight\t\t- Integer that determines how often the substitution will try to be \n\t\t\t   \t   applied and is relative to the other substitution's weights in the \n\t\t\t     \t   transform that have the same substitution type. \n\t* transformations\t- A list of transformations that are defined below.\n\n\tSubstitution Types:\n\t* Motifs are substitutions that likely involve more than one note and give a sense of \n\t   intended progresses between the notes. (e.g. triplet arpeggiation, mordents)\n\t* Embellishments on the otherhand are substitutions that fluff just the target notes of a \n\t   solo and dont change much more than that. (e.g. grace notes, approach tones)\n\n\tSince motifs change the color and tone and embellishments do not, they should not be \n\tapplied to a melody at the same time. For consistent converage of both types of \n\tsubstitutions, substitutions are applied to a melody in two iterators. \n\t\n\tFirst all the motifs are applied to a melody giving a resulting initial transformed melody. \n\tThen the embellishments are applied to the initial transformed melody yielding a final \n\ttransformed melody. That is what is then placed back into the leadsheet. \n\t\n\tGUI:\n\tWhen you click on a substitution from the substitution list, its transformations will appear in \n\tthe list to its right. Tranformations added to that list will then be added to the currently \n\tselected substitution. \n\t\n\tThere are also buttons and boxes to change each of these parts for any selected substitution.\n\n\nTransformations\n\n\tTransformations are basically specific implementations of an idiom that will always \n\tdeterministically result in the same thing given the same input melody selection. \n\tTransformations are defined by two things: a way to transform notes, and a hueristic to \n\tdetermine whether or not a transformation should be applied to a group of notes. \n\n\tTransformation in Grammar Form:\n\t\n\t(transformation\n\t\t(description <string-without-spaces>)\n\t\t(weight <integer>)\n\t\t(source-notes <string> <string> ...)\n\t\t(condition-guard <function>)\n\t\t(target-notes <function|string> <function|string> ...))\n\n\tTransformation Parts:\n\t\t* description\t\t- displays in the list and is used to identify the transformation\n\t\t* weight\t\t- determines how often a transformations is attempted to be \n\t\t\t\t\t   applied, weights are relative to the other transformations in \n\t\t\t\t\t   its substitution\n\t\t* source-notes\t\t- A list of note-variable names used later in the \n\t\t\t\t\t   condition-guard and target-notes. The variable names cannot\n\t\t\t\t\t   be names of functions in the grammar, a possible note string,\n\t\t\t\t\t   a number or contain spaces. (typically they are "n1", "n2", \n\t\t\t\t\t   "n3", etc.) The number of variable names in source-notes \n\t\t\t\t\t   determines how many notes will be transformed. \n\t\t* condition-guard\t- A function that can contain other functions and must return \n\t\t\t\t\t   true for the transformation to be applied (will use variables \n\t\t\t\t\t   names from source-notes).\n\t\t* target-notes\t\t- A list of note-variable names or note returning functions that \n\t\t\t\t\t   replace the source-notes when the transformation is finally \n\t\t\t\t\t   applied.\n\n\tA list of functions the condition-guard and target-notes can use can be found in the\n\tTransform Tab by clicking the button "Show Transformation Functions" button.  \n\n\tFor a transformation to be applied, two conditions must be met. The total duration of the \n\tnotes taken in by source-notes must equal the total duration of the notes returned in \n\ttarget-notes. The condition-guard must return true for the note variables bound in \n\tsource-notes. \n\n\tGUI:\n\tThere is a spinner to change the weight of a selected transformation and there is the ability to\n\tadd and delete transformations in the selected substitution. To change other aspects of the\n\ttransformation though requires you to click the Edit Transformation Button.\n\n\tThe Edit Transformation Button will bring up a text area with the actual grammar \n\trepresentation of a transformation, so is only suggested if you know what you are editing.\n\nProccess of Applying a Transform \n\nA Transform is just a list of substitutions. So when it is applied to a melody, it will divide up the\nmelody into selections and transform each. When it is transforming a selection, it orders its \nsubstitutions in a list randomly but with precedence to substitutions with higher weights. It starts\nat the top of the list and tries to apply the selection to the substitution. If the substitution can be\napplied, the selection is modified to the result of the application. If it cannot be applied, the next\nsubstitution in the list is tried. If no substitution can be applied to a particular selection, the \nselection just remains the same. The transformed melody is then placed back into the leadsheet.\n\nProcess of Applying a Substitution\n\nSubstitutions contain a list of transformations. When a substitution is trying to apply itsself to a \nsection of melody, it orders its transformations in a list randomly but with precedence to \ntransformations with higher weights. The substitution will then start at the top of the list and try to \napply the transformation to the melody selection. If the transformation can be applied the result is \nreturned, else the next transformation in the list is tried. If no transformation can be applied to the \nmelody section, then the substitution cannot be applied. \n\nProcess of Applying a Transformation\n\nApplying a transformation takes 3 steps:\n1. The notes in the segment given are associated with variable names in source notes. \n\tIf the segment was "c4 d4 e2" and source-notes was (source-notes n1 n2 n3),\n\tThe following would be true: n1 = c4, n2 = d4, n3 = e2\n     If the segment contains too few notes to be associated with source-notes, then the\n     the transformation cannot be applied.\n2. Now that the variables-names now have notes associated with them, we can check the validity\n    of the condition-guard. The condition guard is run and if it returns false, the transformation\n    cannot be applied. If it returns true, then step 3 is run.\n3. Now that the huersitic is satisfied, we can get our resulting notes. Each function in target-notes\n    is evaluated and if every note in the resulting list is valid, then the segment given is now replaced\n    with the notes in the evaluated target-notes. If there is an invalid note, or a function is unable to\n    be evaluated, the transform cannot be applied. \n
