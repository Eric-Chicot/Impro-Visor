FirstTimeDialog.aboutText.text=\ \ Welcome to Improvisation Advisor version 10.\n\n  Tutorials: http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/jazz/improvisor/tutorials.html\n\n  This message will appear only the first time you launch a new version.\n  It can be revisited from the Help menu.\n\n  On first launch, Impro-Visor will copy various files from the\n  installation directory to your home directory, in folder:\n\n       impro-visor-version-10-files\n\n  These include leadsheets, styles, and vocabulary. If you want to preserve \n  files from previous versions, you will need to move or copy them manually. \n  This is so Impro-Visor does not overwrite files that you might have\n  modified. When that directory is present, it tells Impro-Visor not to copy\n  the files on next launch and not to show this message again.\n  \n  To get sound, you may need to set the MIDI Output Preference.\n  (You can use the button below.) It should be set to one of:\n\n        Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth  \n        Microsoft MIDI Mapper\n        Gervill\n \n  or some other device or program that supports MIDI input. The latter needs\n  to be running at the time the Impro-Visor is launched, but can be left on.\n\n  Other information can be found in the release notes, in README.txt, and \n  also on the web at https://sourceforge.net/projects/impro-visor/files/\n\n  You can see this message again by Help > Show First-Launch Message.\n
